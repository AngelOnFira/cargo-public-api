# Maintainer guidelines

Here are some guidelines if you are a maintainer:

**A.** Prefer creating PRs when making a change to ensure CI passes before merge. Prefer waiting on code review for non-trivial changes.

**B.** If a change is low-risk, uncontroversial, and should not end up in the automatically generated changelog for releases, it is fine to push directly to main without going through a PR, CR, and CI pipeline. But please run `scripts/run-ci-locally.sh` locally before pushing. And if CI unexpectedly fails after push, please fix it as soon as possible.

**C.** Never manually `cargo publish`. See 'How to release' below.

**D.** Always keep the main branch in a releasable state. This ensures that we can spontaneously and frequently make releases.

**E.** Avoid having large and long-lived branches. That increases the risk of future merge conflicts and sadness. Prefer many, small, incremental, short-lived PRs that is regularly merged to main.

## How to release

### `public-api` and `cargo-public-api`

1. First release `rustdoc-json` if needed. See below.
1. Bump to the same `version` in **public-api/Cargo.toml** and **cargo-public-api/Cargo.toml** (including the dependency on `public-api`), and push to `main`. If you bump 0.x.0 version, also update the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api#compatibility-matrix).
1. If `MINIMUM_RUSTDOC_JSON_VERSION` must be bumped, bump it. If you bump it, also bump it in [installation instruction](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api#installation) and the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api#compatibility-matrix).
1. Label PRs that should not be mentioned in the release notes with `[exclude-from-release-notes]`. Label PRs that should be in the "New Features" section in the auto-generated release notes with `[enhancement]`. You can preview release notes by triggering [this](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/actions/workflows/Peek-release-notes.yml).
1. Run https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/actions/workflows/Release.yml workflow from `main` ([instructions](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/blob/main/docs/development.md#how-to-trigger-main-branch-workflow))
1. Double-check that the release ended up at https://crates.io/crates/public-api/versions and https://crates.io/crates/cargo-public-api/versions
1. Double-check that the auto-generated release notes for the release at https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/releases is not horribly inaccurate. If so, please edit.
1. Done!

### `rustdoc-json`

1. Bump the `version` in **rustdoc-json/Cargo.toml** and the dependencies declared in **public-api/Cargo.toml** and **cargo-public-api/Cargo.toml**.
1. Run https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/actions/workflows/Release-rustdoc-json.yml workflow from `main` ([instructions](https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/blob/main/docs/development.md#how-to-trigger-main-branch-workflow))
1. Double-check that the release ended up at https://crates.io/crates/rustdoc-json/versions
1. Done!

## How to trigger main branch workflow

1. Go to https://github.com/Enselic/cargo-public-api/actions and select workflow in the left column
1. Click the **Run workflow â–¼** button to the right
1. Make sure the `main` branch is selected
1. Click **Run workflow**
