Diffing of public APIs

Usage: cargo-public-api diff [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...

Arguments:
  [ARGS]...
          Diff against published crate versions, between commits, or between rustdoc JSON files. If
          the diffing arg looks like a specific version string (`x.y.z`) then the diffing will be
          performed against a published version of the crate. The presence of `..` means git commits
          will be diffed. The presence of `.json` means rustdoc JSON file diffing will be used.
          
          Examples:
          
          Diffing working tree against a published version of the crate:
          
          cargo public-api diff 1.2.3
          
          Diffing between commits:
          
          cargo public-api diff v0.2.0..v0.3.0
          
          Diffing between rustdoc JSON files:
          
          cargo public-api diff first.json second.json

Options:
      --deny <DENY>
          Exit with failure if the specified API diff is detected.
          
          Can be combined. For example, to only allow additions to the API, use `--deny=added
          --deny=changed`.

          Possible values:
          - all:     All forms of API diffs are denied: additions, changes, deletions
          - added:   Deny added things in API diffs
          - changed: Deny changed things in API diffs
          - removed: Deny removed things in API diffs

      --force
          Force the diff. For example, when diffing commits, enabling this option will discard
          working tree changes during git checkouts of other commits

  -h, --help
          Print help information (use `-h` for a summary)
